# Python-Pokedex

My first big project, completed back in early 2021. The source code is pretty terrible, but it was a blast to make! Definitely still some bugs, but maybe one day I'll deal with them :)

Libraries Required:
urllib.request
PIL.Image - You may need to intsall the Pillow library for this import to work - PIL support was discontinued long ago.
os

It's a simple console app, just open it, install the libraries, and run main.py :)
